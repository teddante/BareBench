## Purpose
This project provides a **minimal Unity application** designed for simple PC benchmarking.  
The program does nothing except:
- Open a Unity window.
- Display an benchmarking stuff

It is intended as a **lightweight, silly, but effective way** to measure raw frame rates and system responsiveness in Unity with zero extra overhead.

## Features
- Bare-bones UI
- Headless Benchmarking
- Minimal assets, no gameplay, no extra rendering load.  
- Cross-platform - Works on hopefully anything
- Run without hassle, plug n play, no config
- A benchmark run on this program is fair between any system its run on, runs the same way for all systems its run on
